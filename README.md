## About

Mis Mementos is a fullstack app that allows users to highlight different memories. Considering that we are all removed from our daily world with COVID-19 we wanted to create an app that highlighted our cherished memoreies. This app was created with three models using object relationship mapping.

## Features
Users are able to log in with their profile and create their memories. Their memories are displayed on a map and they have the ability to edit their memory.

## Getting Started
To use our fullstack app, users will open their terminal and run the following commands for two different repos:

For the backend it is crucial that you first bundle install. Next steps:

rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails s
To run the frontend repo

Have the rails server running on "localhost:3000"

## Stack
Javascript/ React
Ruby on Rails
HTML
CSS

jQuery

## Next Steps
We would like ouy map to include other logos and images for memories.  

Work on making this model accessible using accessibility tools.

Incorporate additional models.

Create rspec files to test our fullstack model.

Add more validations for forms.
